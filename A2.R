# 1. A regular save rewrite the current version of the file. 
#To commit something with Git is similar to saving but it allows for version control tracking.
#Each commit acts as a record the can be gone back too or used to restore work
#Branching allows for two separate commit history to exist in parallel.
#This branched versions can then be merge into the same commit file. 

# 2. Commits through Git allow for version control which can be shared with other users.
#It is also an easy way to track changes.

# 3. .gitignore contains files that Git has been told by the user to ignore. 
#This includes any the user does not committed into the GitHub repository.
#This means it will not show up in the official version.

# 4. You would 'push' our official version of containing your Git files to GitHub 
#and 'pull' changes from GitHub to synchronize with your version.

# 5. Git a version control program allowing for commits 
#is a local repository where GitHub is an online repository where
#files can be pushed and pulled from. This allows for multiple people to work on
#the same git repository
